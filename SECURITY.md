## Security Policy

This document outlines the security policy for [Project Name], a [Project Description]. We take security seriously and are committed to protecting both our users and their data. 

**Supported Versions**

| Version | Supported with Security Updates |
|---|---|
| **5.1.x** | :white_check_mark: |
| 5.0.x | :x: |
| **4.0.x** | :white_check_mark: |
| < 4.0 | :x: |

We prioritize security fixes for the latest supported versions (**currently 5.1.x and 4.0.x**). Older versions (5.0.x and below) are no longer receiving security updates and may be vulnerable to known exploits. We strongly recommend upgrading to a supported version to ensure optimal security.

**Reporting a Vulnerability**

We encourage responsible disclosure of vulnerabilities in our project. If you discover a security vulnerability, please report it to us via the following channels:

* **Email:** [Project Security Email Address]
* **GitHub Issue:** [Project GitHub Security Issue Tracker URL]

Please include the following information in your report:

* **Description of the vulnerability:** A clear and concise explanation of the vulnerability, including any steps to reproduce it.
* **Affected versions:** Indicate which version(s) of the project are vulnerable.
* **Impact of the vulnerability:** Describe the potential impact of the vulnerability, such as data compromise, denial-of-service attack, etc.
* **Proof of concept (optional):** If possible, provide any proof of concept code or evidence of the vulnerability.

**Vulnerability Response Timeline**

We aim to acknowledge vulnerability reports within **24 hours** and provide an initial assessment within **72 hours**. We will work diligently to fix confirmed vulnerabilities and release security patches as soon as possible. 

**Reporting Rewards (optional)**

If you choose to publicly disclose a vulnerability, we encourage you to wait until a patch is available to avoid causing harm to our users. We may offer a reward for responsible disclosure of critical vulnerabilities based on our vulnerability reward program (link to program details, if applicable).

**General Security Practices**

* We regularly review our code for security vulnerabilities using static and dynamic analysis tools.
* We keep our dependencies up-to-date to mitigate known vulnerabilities in external libraries.
* We perform security audits at regular intervals to identify and address potential security weaknesses.

**Thank you for helping us keep [Project Name] secure!**

This policy is subject to change. We will update this document as needed to reflect any changes in our security practices.

**Additionally, you may want to consider adding the following sections to your Security Policy:**

* **Responsible disclosure policy:** Describe the expectations for responsible disclosure and what constitutes misuse of vulnerability information.
* **Security bug bounty program (optional):** If you have a bug bounty program, provide details about the program, such as eligibility criteria, reward amounts, and submission process.
* **Third-party security practices:** Outline how you secure your use of third-party services and libraries.
* **Data security practices:** Explain how you store and protect user data.


Remember to tailor this policy to your specific project and needs.
